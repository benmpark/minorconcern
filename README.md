# A Minor Concern
A minor concern is an in-development audio plugin that will change the modality of audio, e.g., from a major key to a minor key.

### Built With
[JUCE](https://juce.com) framework

## Getting Started
I am just getting started, lol. Nothing to install yet.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Allow for transformation of C-major audio to C-minor
- [ ] Add transformations for all major to parallel minor
- [ ] Tweak settings (tuning, sensitivity, overtones, etc.)
- [ ] Add transformations for all minor to parallel major
- [ ] Add transformation from any major/minor key to any other
- [ ] Add minor scale variations
- [ ] Add modes
- [ ] Enable MIDI features
- [ ] Probably more to come
